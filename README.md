# SN_Corporation_Analysis

### Situation

The goal of the project was to enable the stakeholders to visualize important business metrics and KPIs for a better decision-making process in the company.

### Task

My role in the project was to build an interactive POWER BI dashboard that would provide an intuitive experience and would allow the stakeholder to explore the data effortlessly.

### Action

- I have built an interactive POWER BI dashboard which helps the data to drill down into specific metrics which would allow the stakeholder to make quick analysis and decision-making process.
- I have managed to answer the stakeholder's questions which were as follows:
    1. Total Sales from the Bookcases?
    2. Total Sales from France in February 2017?
    3. Who is the most profitable customer?
    4. Total Sales in the Central Region in Chairs?
    5. Which Shipping mode brought the 2nd most orders in Q3,2018?
       
- Used "Card Visuals" to display the total profit, total cost, and total sales of the company throughout the year(2017 - 2020)
- Used "Table Visuals" to view a list of the company's customers and sales, profit, and cost generated by a particular customer.
- "Column Chart" is used to display KPI for Sales in every subcategory. Whereas "Line Chart" is used to view counts of orders with respect to quarters in years (2017-2020) and shipping mode.
- Used "Pie Chart" to show the quantity of products sold in different regions and segments.
- "Map Chart" is used to display a business by country served.
- Lastly, I added "Slicers" to select multiple shipping modes and Order dates according to user requirements.
